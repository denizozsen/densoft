TO DO

- Create CachedRepository
  -> two choices as cache: 1) request-level cache (context) 2) real cache (memcache)
- Make Router a singleton
- Make Router manage some state
  -> the current request
  -> ordered list of all modules taking part in requests
     -> modules must register themselves as taking part in requests
- Make default error pages work (e.g. for invalid image paths)


DONE
- Create TaskRepository
- Create MasterRepository (instead of EntityLocator)
